Annual RSS conference Android app source code

Author: Alexander Sergian

-----
Use this source code to your leisure. Please give me original author credits =)



I included the Java source files and the layouts/drawables

You should change the package name to your personal package name.
you should change the links. Some of the links are hardcoded in the layouts, some in the string.xml file
You will need to change the events, contacts, etc arrays I created
	-> If you wish, you can create classes to make that easier for you. I didn't have time to finish that

Let me know if you have any questions
